This is a simple submod for [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2887120253]Elder Kings 2[/url] that tweaks the Skaal clothing to make it a bit more distinct from the rest of the Atmorans of Tamriel!

Inspired by their depiction in [b]The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim[/b], I have chosen to replace their non-combat clothing with the Khanty clothing coming in the Arctic Attire Content Creator Pack.
